# ML_Ride_Sharing
A Machine Learning Recommender Model for Ride Sharing Based on Rider Characteristics and User Threshold Time

The project is a master thesis and forms a part of the graduate course work. Initially, riders register to the system with five specific characteristics on a scale of 1 to 5. Also, riders provide the User Threshold Time or the UTT, which is the maximum waiting time in minutes in the range of 10 to 30 minutes. Based on similar rider characteristics and UTT, the system matches riders and creates a trip itinerary. In the second phase, the Machine Learning Content-Based Reccomdation algorithm is utilized for rider matching. Also, based on the rider's feedback patters, two main characteristics on which the rider most focusses are determined. Based on the computed main characteristics, the search criteria for riders is dynamically defined. 

SVMs or Support Vector Machines are utilized for computing the main characteristics for newly registering riders and, passengers are recommended based on computed main characteristics. The primary motive of the thesis is to increase Ride Sharing services, which indirectly results in a reduction of heavy traffic, rapid consumptions of the fuel resources, emissions by vehicles, and overall contributes to the quality of the environment.

Project is built using Pycharm and MongoDB.
Libraries - Sklearn, Pandas, Statistics(for variance)
